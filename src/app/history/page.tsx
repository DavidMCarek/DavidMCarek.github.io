        <h1>A not so brief history of my software development experience.</h1>

        <p>
          I started learning software development through a partnership program
          between the Lorain County Community College and the University of
          Toledo. It was there that I learned the very basics of object oriented
          proramming, computer security, and several programming languages{'('}
          Java, c++, MASM{')'}. The degree program is also setup so that I was
          able to gain real world experience through co-ops. So while I was
          working on coursework, I was also working at The Ridge Tool Company.

        <p>
          I started out with a strong interest in JavaScript. After watching
          many hours of pluralsight videos I learned most of the quirks of
          JavaScript and how to develop in a clean maintainable way. At the time
          I was using mostly plain old JavaScript with some jQuery as well. I
          also had a bit of a catch phrase.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          JavaScript is like the wild west so it{"'"}s easy to tell the
          difference between a good JavaScript developer and a bad one.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This held true in my experiences especially because I was working with
          a lot of co-ops whose experience with software development focused on
          strongly typed object oriented languages that have guardrails in place
          due to how opinionated they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continued in my career I dabbled in the major FE frameworks.
